# Introduction

Welcome to the FullStack Leveler course! This course is designed to provide you with both example projects and exercises, ensuring you can keep up with all the content. Each section builds upon the previous one, so it's important not to skip any content. Even if you find some sections easy, we recommend reviewing them to refresh your knowledge.

## Course Overview

## Course Structure

Each section of the course includes both lessons and exercises. The exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the lessons. We use the [Mastery Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning) approach to help you master the course materials.

We understand that you may encounter challenges during the course. We are here to provide support and assistance as much as possible.

## Using AI Tools

In the world of **LLM (Large Language Model)**, you may find yourself using AI tools frequently. For this course, please use AI tools as assistants to help you learn by providing clues, not exact answers that you can simply copy and paste.

:::tip Remember
For the course, please refrain from using any AI plugins in your IDE, such as Copilot, Gemini, etc.
